# todo - persist casevac
# todo - herc infantry is too many (seemed like 30 per group with 3 groups)
# todo - rpg dudes in the herc infantry?
# CTLD has entries from herc drops or something? "Infantry"

# spread out save and spawn

# drop troops one per time - have to hack moose up for this
# todo add frontlines -
# maybe precalulate the lines by taking the centers of the previous and current zone (or the strand fighter if the first zone),
# make a line between them, figure out which edge of the zone it intersects, then use the vertices of that edge to draw the actual
# line

# casevac mission doesn't work
# make it so ctld spec ops group dropped will COMMANDO a command center
# put static version of every single thing over in the corner so textures load
# consider making QRF spawn at QRF center or something
# implement drip of airwing resources (maybe have "factories" build them)
# on a restart, clean up any crates in a farp or airbase, and clean up any blue units that are not in a farp, airbase, current objective zone, or previous objective zone
# objectives not listing status

# overlord on AM band
# add a4 to paphos
